## This is my private repo for my BD-1 animatronic droid. 

**Information**
Nothing to note as of yet - this is my initial git commit. 

The BD-1 Software sandbox is a largely AI/vibe coded program that will let me test fuctions before installing and pushing to a PI, such as expected servo position, LED PWM and Colors, and it will have mic and speaker access to test the LLM integration with the audio files.
